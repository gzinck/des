def construct_arena(automaton):
    """Constructs an arena from an automaton, as specified in (Ricker, Marchand,
    & Keroglou, 2019). The arena has the same form as a regular automaton,
    except with a few extra features. The "states" section has two extra lists:
    "v1" and "v2", which correspond to the two distinct types of states.
    The "transitions" section has two extra lists as well: "v1" and "v2", which
    are the two transition lists that exit out of the two sets of states,
    respectively.

    Note
    ----
    Any data on bad states or transitions will be not be included in the
    resulting automaton.
    Also, the automaton must have three entries in marked, observable, and
    controllable. The first is the controller's perspective, the second is the
    first agent's perspective, and the third is the second agent's perspective.
    Note that the two agents' events should be subsets of the controller's event
    set.
    TODO: add a verifier to ensure correct input.

    Parameters
    ----------
    automaton : dict
        The automaton for which to create an arena

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        The resulting arena

    Examples
    --------
    >>> arena = construct_arena(automaton)
    >>> print(arena)
    {
        # Dictionary for the arena with the added features specified above
    }
